              <h4 class="timeline-title">ONE FOR THE KIDS:</h4>
            
                <p class="timeline-text">This spring, dozens hit the links for Chipping in for Charity, ACHC’s third annual sponsored golf tournament, raising $35,000 for both Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Triangle and SAFEchild. We’d like to thank our Platinum Sponsor, NextLOGiK, and our Gold Sponsor, 21st Century Home Health Consulting Services, in addition to the rest of our corporate sponsors. ACHC is fortunate to be in a position to help support these wonderful local youth programs, and we look forward to continuing to do so in the years to come!</p>
                    <h4 class="timeline-title">HELPING OUR NEIGHBORS:</h4>
                <p class="timeline-text">ACHC gave $10,000 to Direct Relief to assist with aid and recovery efforts in response to destruction from Hurricane Florence’s September 2018 landfall in North and South Carolina. “We are encouraged by the caring response we have seen from people coming together to help each other in recovery,” said ACHC Senior Manager of Human Resources Suzanne Pritchard. ACHC President & CEO José Domingos also applauded the donation. “Our hearts go out to those who may have lost loved ones and our hope is that contributions like this can help with what will be a long road to recovery,” he said.</p>
                <h4 class="timeline-title"> SOUP KITCHEN SHIFT:</h4>
                <p class="timeline-text"> Members of our Marketing and Business Development teams rolled up their sleeves, and tied on kitchen aprons, for a lunchtime shift at Shepherd’s Table Soup Kitchen in downtown Raleigh. Hundreds of savory, healthy meals were served to clients of the soup kitchen. The organization served 76,000 needy guests last year alone.</p>

                <h4 class="timeline-title">PAYING IT FORWARD</h4>
                <p class="timeline-text">Eclipse glasses certainly make a nice keepsake, but ACHC’s Jeff Freer had a better idea: Donate frames from the company’s eclipse-viewing party to Astronomers Without Borders. The California-based organization, in partnership with Explore Scientific, will send the glasses to schools and other institutions in South America and Asia for eclipses that will cross those continents in 2019.</p>
                <h4 class="timeline-title">CHIPPING IN FOR CHARITY</h4>
                <p class="timeline-text">Our second-annual charity golf tournament was a resounding success. After a drizzly morning, the skies over Brier Creek Country Club cleared and golfers were able to enjoy 18 holes of golf. We are so grateful to the many sponsors, donors, players, and volunteers who helped us raise $30,000 for Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Triangle, which provides youth mentoring, and SAFEchild, an organization committed to eliminating child abuse. A special thank you goes out to our Platinum Sponsor, Dependable Health Services. See you on the links next year!</p>
                <h4 class="timeline-title">AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION’S 2017 TRIANGLE HEART WALK</h4>
                <p class="timeline-text">ACHC employees laced up their track shoes and brought along friends and family at PNC Arena. The Heart Walk is the American Heart Association’s premiere event in the fight against the country’s No. 1 and No. 5 killers, heart disease and stroke. The day was filled with energy, excitement, and hope. The annual event is designed to promote physical activity and heart-healthy living, and the Heart Walk creates an environment that’s both fun and rewarding for the entire family. ACHC raised more than $5,000 toward life-saving scientific research, and we continue to partner with them to leverage their many Wellness resources.</p>
